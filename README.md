## Project Overview

In this assignment, students explored object-oriented programming concepts by creating a set of classes representing different geometric shapes. The program provides an interactive user interface to calculate and display the area and perimeter of these shapes.

## Usage

1. Select a shape (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Square) or type 'exit' to quit.
2. Based on the selected shape, provide the necessary dimensions (e.g., width, height, radius).
3. The program will calculate and display the area and perimeter of the selected shape.
4. Repeat the process until you choose to exit the program.

## Shapes Supported

- **Rectangle**: Calculates area and perimeter based on width and height.
- **Circle**: Calculates area and perimeter based on the radius.
- **Triangle**: Calculates area and perimeter based on the lengths of its sides.
- **Square**: A special case of Rectangle with all sides equal.

## How to Run

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the source code using the following command:

   ```shell
   javac Main.java
